      "Content": "Mr Gautam Adani is the Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, which ranks among the top 3 industrial conglomerates in India. Mr Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur, is driven by the core philosophy of infusing 'Growth with Goodness' through his nation-building vision. Each of the Group's businesses focuses on helping build world-class infrastructure capabilities to help accelerate the growth of India. Adani Group consists of 7 publicly listed entities with a combined market capitalization in excess of $242.73 billion (as of August 29, 2022) with businesses spanning Energy, Ports & Logistics, Mining & Resources, Gas, Defence & Aerospace, and Airports. The Group has established a leadership position in India in each of its business areas. For Mr Adani, nation-building means transforming India's coastline by building a string of ports and logistics hubs. For him, nation-building also means strengthening the country's energy security and mitigating the urban-rural divide by delivering electricity to several hundreds of millions living in the hinterlands of India. Nation-building, for Mr Adani, also involves boosting food security by building a modern agriculture supply chain and empowering the farmers. Each of his industrial endeavours has created tens of thousands of jobs. Mr Adani aims to make India one of the most significant players in sustainable energy by investing in the renewable ecosystem spanning solar manufacturing, generation, and solar park businesses. He dreams of making India self-reliant in defence and security. The Group has a strong track record of working with global business leaders who want to participate in India's growth story. The global expertise of these international companies in their respective businesses, combined with the project execution and market capabilities of Adani Group, has created enduring partnerships. The partners include Wilmar Group, Total SA, and Elbit Systems. Adani Foundation, the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility arm, is among his key interest areas. The Foundation's pan-India initiatives across critical sectors of education, healthcare, sustainable livelihoods, and community infrastructure development touch more than 3.4 million lives annually in 2315 villages across 18 Indian states."
